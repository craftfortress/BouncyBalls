BouncyBalls by Chris Ridley 20/07/2016

Install dependencies (grunt):
	npm install

To run:
	Type "Grunt" to compile

	Then navigate to the build directory and load "build/index.html" in a browser. 

To test:
	Open test/runner.html

Instructions:
	Click the mouse to make a ball appear and fly at a random direction and velocity

Extending the game / Future Improvements:
	I have commented out working code to allow balls touching collision detection
	The creation of a separate View and Particle object allows for easy separation of concerns and extension of particle properties
